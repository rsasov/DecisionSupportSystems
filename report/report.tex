Our goal is to make a system which, provided with symptoms and users personal information as an input data, has the ability to give a final adequate and precise enough suggestion of disease and following treatment. We decided to develop a chatbot having those functionalities. The chatbot is to be used as a helping tool for medical experts and as an informational tool for users, it should have a good user interface design.	The system should NOT be used as a tool, that can be trusted completely and blindly, replacing the medical experts expertise. }

	In this project we aim to create a knowledge-based decision support system working in the field of medicine or more specifically in the field of diagnosis making.
	\paragraph{}
    Today a lot of those systems exist but they have a bad reputation because of their poor decision-making mechanism. Most of us, as users, have tried to check our symptoms, on \textit{Google} per example, and ended up with a disappointing result rather than a convenient one. In other words most of the time the diagnosis made is concerning some deadly diseases.
    \paragraph{}
	That’s the system that we don’t want to create.
	\paragraph{} 
	Our goal is to make a system, which provided with symptoms and user personal information as input data, has the ability to give a final adequate and precise enough suggestion of disease followed by advice. We want to make a system that helps people go to the right place to be taken care of fast and provides support for better auto-medication.
	We decided to achieve this by creating a bot based decision support system.
	\paragraph{}
	First we need to decide the data model and database structure, we want to use.
	\paragraph{}
	The bot, as input, is not only taking symptoms but also important side factors as height, weight, age and habits that we call \textit{personal information}. Taking in consideration those factors is making the final decision more precise. 
	\paragraph{}
	In order to retrieve the symptoms we use a classifier using python scikit-learn for natural language processing. The classifier allows us to understand the complaints written as by the user and associate them to the symptoms.
	\paragraph{}
	The decision-making strategy is based on scores. With every given answer connected to a symptom the possible set with diseases is reduced until we have a small enough set which can guarantee us decision with good precision. If case of equality the user personal data gathered at the beginning is used to determine the final decision. 
	\paragraph{}
	Along with the decision our bot is providing the user with advice about treatment. We have 3 categories of advices :
	“Self-treatment” ; “Visit your doctor” and “Go to ER”. 
	\paragraph{}
	For the logic in the bot we are using Telegram Bot.
