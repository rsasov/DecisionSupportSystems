	\abstractText{In this project we aimed to create a knowledge-based decision support system working in the field of medicine or more specifically in the field of diagnosis making. Our goal was making a system, which provided with symptoms and users personal information as an input data, has the ability to give a final adequate and precise enough suggestion of disease and following treatment. We decided to develop a chatbot having those functionalities.	The chatbot is made to be used only as a helping tool for medical experts and as an informational tool for users and it should have good user interface design.	The system should NOT be used as a tool, that can be trusted completely and blindly, replacing the medical experts expertise. }%TODO
