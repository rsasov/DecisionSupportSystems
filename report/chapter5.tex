\paragraph{}
In order for this project to become more than a prototype a number of steps have to be made. First the need to create a complete database of symptoms and diseases along with a solution to our Big Data problem. Then a more complete and elaborated dataset for our classifier allowing us to increase its accuracy. 

\paragraph{}
As	a	future	plan,	strengthening	the	text	analysis	and	the	accuracy	can	be	shown	first.	Along	with	the	improvements	that	can	be	made	in	algorithms	for	text	analysis	and	diagnostics,	it	is	possible	to	strengthen	the	application	using	deep	learning	and	neural	networks	techniques.	It	is	also	necessary	to	remove	the	handicap	created	by	the	lack	of	available	ready-made	health	data,	one	of	our	biggest	problems.	In	this	context,	doctors	should	be	included	in	the	team	to	be	able	to	return	accurate	results	to	the	user	with	a	more	accurate	data	architecture.	Because	the	medical	sector	is	so	large	and	complex,	the	medical	doctor	team	has	a	paramount	importance.	In	addition	to	this,	we	can	help	user's	self-monitoring	as	well	as	helping	the	doctor	diagnose	the	patient	more	quickly	by	keeping	the	user	health	data	as	Ada	Health	application	does.		In	addition,	such	applications	often	remain	behind	language	barriers.	In	other	words,	a	language	support	to	be	added	next	to	the	English	speaker	can	help	us	to	increase	the	target	audience.
